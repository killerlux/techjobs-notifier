## Will I see new jobs within ~1 hour?

**For companies that use supported job boards: yes.** The pipeline runs every 30 minutes (GitHub Action). So a new posting that lands on Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workable, SmartRecruiters, Amazon Jobs, or Microsoft Careers can show up in the next run (within ~30–60 min, depending on when it was posted).

**Coverage today:**

| Source | Companies in list | Fetched? |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workable, SmartRecruiters | 86 | Yes (JSON/API) |
| Amazon Jobs, Microsoft Careers | 2 (hardcoded) | Yes (JSON/API) |
| Workday, Eightfold | 23 | **No** (skipped – no fetcher) |

So **23 companies** (including many big names on Workday) are never polled. New jobs there will not appear here until we add support.

**JSON vs HTML scraping:**  
For the 86 + 2 above we only use JSON/APIs (no scraping). For Workday and similar, there is no public API; you’d need either reverse‑engineered JSON calls or HTML scraping. Scraping is more work and can break when the site changes, but once implemented it does work. So: **JSON is enough for “within 1 hour” for supported portals; to cover the rest you need scrapers or Workday-style API handling.**
